TODO : 

* case above 
* make automated ? how to handle things not executing ?
* test case for multiple Content-Type headers and XCTO
* test case for multiple X-Content-Type-Options headers
* test cases for invalid X-Content-Type-Options header
** no value
** bogus value
* test case with src when Content-Type is blank/missing
* argue that since nosniff doesn't affect anything but javascript
** or text/html being sniffed writing a bunch of negative tests isn't
** a good use of time - maybe one is worth having ?
* run test suite in Firefox / Chrome / IE and record results
